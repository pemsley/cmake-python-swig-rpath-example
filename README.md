How do CMake, Python, SWIG and RPATH work together? 

We are encouraged (aren't we?) to use modern tools appropriate for the job - and those seem to be
(at least in my little part of the scientific world) CMake, Python, C++ and SWIG to glue them together.

How should we do that exactly?

Now try it using RPATH.

Now try it on a Mac... Hmm...

I did some googling and reading and the answer to that was utterly opaque to me.

So here's a project simply designed to the the project that I would have like to have found 
several weeks ago.

Some interesting reading:
